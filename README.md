# Security Notifications Using Stacks
A notifications system using stacks.


<hr>

### What is the purpose of this project?
The purpose of this project is to create a notifications system using stacks that allows a user to insert, remove, get the size of, and print the message queue beginning with the most recent. This would be the center of a security system that is designed to give the latest messages in case of a DDOS attack but will also store previous messages and give more context to the user as they retrieve more messages from the queue. 

### How much time will it take?
You should plan to allocate about 30 hours between now and the end of the semester to building your project around the data structure that you have selected.

### How will the project be evaluated?
The proposal grade accounts for 30% of your overall project score. You should write at most a Two Page description of your proposal.  You can write it in a word processor and add a PDF version to your project repository or you can add a markdown file to your project repository and write the proposal in the markdown language you see here. 

**Your proposal is going to be graded by your fellow students.**

The proposal grading will take the following into consideration:
* is it clearly and coherently stating the problem that you're attempting to solve
* have you defended your choice of data structure (e.g. why did you X and not use Y or Z instead?)
* have you provided a description of your plan for implementing different parts of the code
   * How many functions do you think your data structure should have? 
   * What do each of the functions accomplish?
   * How are you planning to implement each function? (what is the basic algorithm?)
   * Do you need recursive functions?
   *  . . .
* have you provided a definition of what 'done' looks like for the project. 
   * you might propose writing unit-tests similar to class homework. If you do then you should discuss how your tests are going to look.
   * what test cases should the project be able to handle when project is completed?

### Interview Grading
You don't need to write anything after the project is done, we are going to grade your project over an interview grading meeting. 
Interview grading schedules are going to be out during finals week.
